# Borg readiness

## Current verdict

- Controlled first-10 beta: **NO-GO for this source revision until `agent-borg==3.3.14` is published and PyPI fresh-install + stdio MCP canaries pass.**
- Public waitlist / narrow beta: **NO-GO for `agent-borg==3.3.14` until PyPI latest, fresh-install, and stdio MCP canaries pass for that exact version**; after that, keep the rollout controlled to at most 10 consented users until row-derived evidence passes.
- Public self-serve launch: **NO-GO until real external-user evidence exists**.

## What passed for source/local package infrastructure

- Public install path exists: `python3 -m pip install agent-borg`.
- CLI entrypoints exist: `borg`, `borg-mcp`, `borg-doctor`.
- First value path exists: `borg rescue "<error>"` returns ACTION / STOP / VERIFY or `NO_CONFIDENT_MATCH`.
- First-10 contract exists: [`FIRST_10_BETA_READINESS.md`](FIRST_10_BETA_READINESS.md).
- Security/privacy/prompt-injection surface has a baseline and CI gates.
- Current default-branch GitHub CI and security gates are green.
- PyPI latest/fresh-install/stdio MCP canary must be rerun for `agent-borg==3.3.14`; until then this source revision is not controlled-beta package ready.

## What is not proven

- Agent-level success lift at statistical confidence.
- Real external-user network effects.
- Broad non-Python coverage.
- Global/federated multi-node reliability.
- Public self-serve onboarding at scale.

## First-10 success threshold

10 consented external users, at least 8 successful installs, at least 6 useful ACTION / STOP / VERIFY rescue moments without maintainer handholding, and 0 critical privacy/security incidents. Every miss must be recorded as `NO_CONFIDENT_MATCH` or explicit negative feedback instead of hidden.
