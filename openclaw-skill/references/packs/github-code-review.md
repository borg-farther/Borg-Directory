# Github Code Review

**Confidence:** inferred
**Problem class:** Review code changes by analyzing git diffs, leaving inline comments on PRs, and performing thorough pre-push review. Works with gh CLI or falls back to git + GitHub REST API via curl.

## Required Inputs
- task_description: what you need to accomplish

## Phases

### 1__reviewing_local_changes__pre_push
This is pure `git` — works everywhere, no API needed.

### Get the Diff

```bash
# Staged changes (what would be committed)
git diff --staged

# All changes vs main (what a PR would contain)
git diff main...HEAD

# File names only
git diff main...HEAD --name-only

# Stat summary (insertions/deletions per file)
git diff main...HEAD --stat
```

### Review Strategy

1. **Get the big picture first:**

```bash
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git log main..HEAD --oneline
```

2. **Review file by file** — use `read_file` on changed files for full context, and the diff to see what changed:

```bash
git diff main...HEAD -- src/auth/login.py
```

3. **Check for common issues:**

```bash
# Debug statements, TODOs, console.logs left behind
git diff main...HEAD | grep -n "print(\|console\.log\|TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|debugger"

# Large files accidentally staged
git diff main...HEAD --stat | sort -t'|' -k2 -rn | head -10

# Secrets or credential patterns
git diff main...HEAD | grep -in "credential\|sensitive value\|API access\|auth credential.*=\|private_key"

# Merge conflict markers
git diff main...HEAD | grep -n "<<<<<<\|>>>>>>\|======="
```

4. **Present structured feedback** to the user.

### Review Output Format

When reviewing local changes, present findings in this structure:

```

**Checkpoint:** Verify 1. reviewing local changes (pre-push) is complete and correct.

### code_review_summary
### Critical
- **src/auth.py:45** — SQL injection: user input passed directly to query.
  Suggestion: Use parameterized queries.

### Warnings
- **src/models/user.py:23** — credential stored in plaintext. Use bcrypt or argon2.
- **src/api/routes.py:112** — No rate limiting on login endpoint.

### Suggestions
- **src/utils/helpers.py:8** — Duplicates logic in `src/core/utils.py:34`. Consolidate.
- **tests/test_auth.py** — Missing edge case: expired auth credential test.

### Looks Good
- Clean separation of concerns in the middleware layer
- Good test coverage for the happy path
```

**Checkpoint:** Verify code review summary is complete and correct.

### 2__reviewing_a_pull_request_on_github
### View PR Details

**With gh:**

```bash
gh pr view 123
gh pr diff 123
gh pr diff 123 --name-only
```

**With git + curl:**

```bash
PR_NUMBER=123

# Get PR details
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: auth credential $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
pr = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(f\"Title: {pr['title']}\")
print(f\"Author: {pr['user']['login']}\")
print(f\"Branch: {pr['head']['ref']} -> {pr['base']['ref']}\")
print(f\"State: {pr['state']}\")
print(f\"Body:\n{pr['body']}\")"

# List changed files
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: auth credential $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/files \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
for f in json.load(sys.stdin):
    print(f\"{f['status']:10} +{f['additions']:-4} -{f['deletions']:-4}  {f['filename']}\")"
```

### Check Out PR Locally for Full Review

This works with plain `git` — no `gh` needed:

```bash
# Fetch the PR branch and check it out
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123
git checkout pr-123

# Now you can use read_file, search_files, run tests, etc.

# View diff against the base branch
git diff main...pr-123
```

**With gh (shortcut):**

```bash
gh pr checkout 123
```

### Leave Comments on a PR

**General PR comment — with gh:**

```bash
gh pr comment 123 --body "Overall looks good, a few suggestions below."
```

**General PR comment — with curl:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: auth credential $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments \
  -d '{"body": "Overall looks good, a few suggestions below."}'
```

### Leave Inline Review Comments

**Single inline comment — with gh (via API):**

```bash
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view 123 --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')

gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/123/comments \
  --method POST \
  -f body="This could be simplified with a list comprehension." \
  -f path="src/auth/login.py" \
  -f commit_id="$HEAD_SHA" \
  -f line=45 \
  -f side

**Checkpoint:** Verify 2. reviewing a pull request on github is complete and correct.

### 3__review_checklist
When performing a code review (local or PR), systematically check:

### Correctness
- Does the code do what it claims?
- Edge cases handled (empty inputs, nulls, large data, concurrent access)?
- Error paths handled gracefully?

### Security
- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or API accesss
- Input validation on user-facing inputs
- No SQL injection, XSS, or path traversal
- Auth/authz checks where needed

### Code Quality
- Clear naming (variables, functions, classes)
- No unnecessary complexity or premature abstraction
- DRY — no duplicated logic that should be extracted
- Functions are focused (single responsibility)

### Testing
- New code paths tested?
- Happy path and error cases covered?
- Tests readable and maintainable?

### Performance
- No N+1 queries or unnecessary loops
- Appropriate caching where beneficial
- No blocking operations in async code paths

### Documentation
- Public APIs documented
- Non-obvious logic has comments explaining "why"
- README updated if behavior changed

**Checkpoint:** Verify 3. review checklist is complete and correct.

### 4__pre_push_review_workflow
When the user asks you to "review the code" or "check before pushing":

1. `git diff main...HEAD --stat` — see scope of changes
2. `git diff main...HEAD` — read the full diff
3. For each changed file, use `read_file` if you need more context
4. Apply the checklist above
5. Present findings in the structured format (Critical / Warnings / Suggestions / Looks Good)
6. If critical issues found, offer to fix them before the user pushes

---

**Checkpoint:** Verify 4. pre-push review workflow is complete and correct.

### 5__pr_review_workflow__end_to_end
When the user asks you to "review PR #N", "look at this PR", or gives you a PR URL, follow this recipe:

### Step 1: Set up environment

```bash
source ~/.hermes/skills/github/github-auth/scripts/gh-env.sh
# Or run the inline setup block from the top of this skill
```

### Step 2: Gather PR context

Get the PR metadata, description, and list of changed files to understand scope before diving into code.

**With gh:**
```bash
gh pr view 123
gh pr diff 123 --name-only
gh pr checks 123
```

**With curl:**
```bash
PR_NUMBER=123

# PR details (title, author, description, branch)
curl -s -H "Authorization: auth credential $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_OWNER/$GH_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER

# Changed files with line counts
curl -s -H "Authorization: auth credential $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_OWNER/$GH_REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/files
```

### Step 3: Check out the PR locally

This gives you full access to `read_file`, `search_files`, and the ability to run tests.

```bash
git fetch origin pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:pr-$PR_NUMBER
git checkout pr-$PR_NUMBER
```

### Step 4: Read the diff and understand changes

```bash
# Full diff against the base branch
git diff main...HEAD

# Or file-by-file for large PRs
git diff main...HEAD --name-only
# Then for each file:
git diff main...HEAD -- path/to/file.py
```

For each changed file, use `read_file` to see full context around the changes — diffs alone can miss issues visible only with surrounding code.

### Step 5: Run automated checks locally (if applicable)

```bash
# Run tests if there's a test suite
python -m pytest 2>&1 | tail -20
# or: npm test, cargo test, go test ./..., etc.

# Run linter if configured
ruff check . 2>&1 | head -30
# or: eslint, clippy, etc.
```

### Step 6: Apply the review checklist (Section 3)

Go through each category: Correctness, Security, Code Quality, Testing, Performance, Documentation.

### Step 7: Post the review to GitHub

Collect your findings and submit them as a formal review with in

**Checkpoint:** Verify 5. pr review workflow (end-to-end) is complete and correct.


## Examples
**Example 1:**
- Problem: Agent reviewed a PR locally but only looked at the diff — missed that a function was incorrectly called in 3 other files
- Solution: 1__reviewing_local_changes__pre_push: For each changed file, used read_file to see full context. Found incorrect function call pattern in related files.
- Outcome: Systematic issue found across codebase, not just in the diff. PR blocked until all call sites fixed.

**Example 2:**
- Problem: Agent posted a review to GitHub but didn't check out the PR locally, so couldn't run tests
- Solution: 5__pr_review_workflow__end_to_end: Checked out PR locally, ran test suite. Found 2 failing tests that diff alone wouldn't reveal.
- Outcome: CI failures caught before merge. Review posted with full test results.

**Example 3:**
- Problem: Agent reviewed a 50-file PR in one pass and missed several issues
- Solution: 3__review_checklist: Applied structured checklist (Correctness, Security, Code Quality, Testing, Performance, Documentation) systematically to each file.
- Outcome: All 8 issues found across 6 categories. Organized feedback by severity.


## Escalation
- If stuck after 2 attempts, ask the user for guidance
